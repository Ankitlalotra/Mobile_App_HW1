1. Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.

I did not talk to any classmates since I do not know them and we also did not have class but I did talk to my cousins who are also in the computer science field and they gave me some ideas on how to improve/solve some problems I might have building an app. They told me to use SwiftUI in Xcode to build apps for apple since I do not own any android phones or have any experience with them. One of my cousins taught me how to get started with SwiftUI, none of them have much experience in building an app but they know some tricks that they said they will show me once I start constructing my app.

1. Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.

I personally want to make my app free and accessible to everyone because I believe my app will be something that will help people’s heath and help them maintain it but it will possibly have in-app purchases that will depend on the customers choice on if they want to buy it or not. Also, I will not be putting in any ads since they are the one thing that annoy me the most so I do not want to bother other people with them.

1. Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.

I will be using SwiftUI in Xcode since Xcode is the one application I have most experience in coding with vs VisualStudios or something like that. Plus, I am a strong apple user so I want to develop apps for apple vs anyone else. I will try my best to make my app both apple and android based but I do not have what type of different challenges that will bring to the app. Also, to me the SwiftUI interface is just a lot more easier and neater for me to work with vs any other ones.

1. Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.

The discussions that I have had with my family and friends have gotten me closer to two apps that they want me to make. One was my own preference, it mainly focuses on changing teslas interface in the car but in-order for to this I have to contact Tesla and ask for their permission and help with it. The other one which seems for realistic was making an app that allows you to track how much water you drink, tells you everything about it. Stores information, gives you different awards based on how much water you drink and so forth. I would most likely go with this but I will work on the Tesla app as my own project I don’t want to bother anyone else with it. Plus it would my car as a test subject and I don’t want to give anyone else access to my car.
